# Washington State Spatial Data API

A full CRUD API created using technologies including: Django framework, Docker container , Elephant SQL database and deployed to AWS, with the aim of trying to provide a centralized website for Washington state geospatial data .

As a geospatial specialist, it takes time browsing through different website, trying to find needed data. The API is created to allow  individuals/students/Geospatial scientist to post end point URL to certain data, with brief description of the data to include : State , Type ,Attributes , Duration , URL , description and the person responsible for adding that information. Interestingly, user can be able to add hosted end point zip URL, allowing Spatial data to be downloadable from this API.

Creation of this API was part of My master thesis, which had elements on why it is currently harder for scientist to find relevant data while there is some much information in the internet.
